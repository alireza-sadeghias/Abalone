/*
 * Automatically play games and get results right away.
 * Some notes:
 * -the board, marbles and move already have to be created.
 * -the parameter is the board.
 * -this will return the board, but it is also possible to return the number of moves.
 * -i made it so that when you push the "perform ai move" button in the gamegui, it automatically runs a whole game.
 * -can run multiple games in a row.
 * -if you want to do it with multiple ais, the ai needs to be changed before this method is ran again.
